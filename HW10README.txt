The only new classes specifically created for HW10 is the Editor View classThe EasyAnimator class in the view was split up so that it now only includes the command line arguments parser and the and a line of code to create an instance of the new Controller class and to use the runAnimation method on that object.TimeComparator3 was removed as it had no use. The only TimeComparator classes needed were the classes TimeComparatorStart (sorts Transformation objects by start time) and TimeComparatorEnd (sorts them by end time), both of which remain.Control is then handed over to the newly made Controller object which takes the command line arguments as strings and converts them to the more necessary types (speed is converted to an Integer, in to a FileReader, out to a PrintStream). The animations are then run based on what type of view is provided in the command line arguments.The playback features required the creation of three ActionListener classes: one to play the animation (in Controller), one to activate the playback button functionality, and one to change the speed of the animation (latter two in EditorView).AbstractTransformation has been altered to contain a tweening method, pullFrame(). AbstractShape has a new method createFrame() which calls on the Transformation objects in the Shape's getChanges list. It created a new Shape object whose attributes are tweened from the transformations the shape is undergoing at the indicated frame in pullFrame().
